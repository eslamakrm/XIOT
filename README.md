				
this code has two versions 
       1 - version 1.0 without classes
       2 - version 2.0 with classes




assumptions : 
	1 - switch is connected as pullup so when pressed the input value is zero[LOW]
	2 - led connected as active high so to lighting it the output pin made high
			
this code is tested on ardunio uno and worked well
